# Handle bookmarks. This uses the static named directories feature of
# zsh. Such directories are declared with `hash -d
# name=directory`. Both prompt expansion and completion know how to
# handle them. We populate the hash with directories.
#
# With autocd, you can just type `~-bookmark`. Since this can be
# cumbersome to type, you can also type `@@` and this will be turned
# into `~-` by ZLE.
